What is the Command Design Pattern?

1. Allow you to store a list of code that is executed at a later time or many times.
2. Client says I want a specific behavioral.command to run when execute() is called on 1 of these encapsulated (hidden) Objects.
3. An object called the Invoker transfers this behavioral.command to another object called the Receiver to execute the right code.
